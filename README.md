My 100-days-of-code followed the scheduled is as per the task list below. I had split the 100-days into 15-20 specific topics, each topic stretching to at least 5 days. 

h3. Notes

1. Since I wanted to learn Azure and pass some of their certifications, those are some of the topics considered, you can leave them out and replace them with your own tasks from your bucket-list.
1. Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) tasks can also be left out & replaced with other tasks specific to the topic.

h2. Planning the Tasks & Topics for 100 Days

This itself is a task on its own which is not listed but were done the days preceding the "marathon". You would also need to do this planning on your own if you are changing any topics are tasks.

h3. Setup CI/CD Server & Write scripts to handle check-ins

- [ ] Setup GoCD server in DigitalOcean with the PostgreSQL & Analytics extension
    * Find out how to model manual testing in GoCD pipeline.
    * Setup GoCD pipelines & scripts to track the time spent on completing courses. This is to be done in [online-course-notes repo]().
    * Setup GoCD pipeline for this repo with the script to update the daily task(s) status' & track the time spent on each one using the [GTM]() utility.

    * [Deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) or [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) - which one? Not sure if any one has compared but many suggest to use CoC, [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ares04/deoplete_vs_cocnvim/) asking for suggestions.
    * The Deoplete git repo recommends moving to [DDC](https://github.com/Shougo/ddc.vim) which is based on [Deno](https://deno.land) and [denops.vim](https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim).
    * Do we need the above plugins if we use LSP server & one of client plugins? Looks like CoC is also an LSP client.
    * Which LSP client plugin ? [vim-lsc](https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc) or [vim-lsp](prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) - Comments in [vim-lsc issue #279](https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc/issues/279) suggest to use vim-lsc, but no comments in [vim-lsp issue ##816](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp#816).
    * LSP in vim with LSC Plugin](https://bluz71.github.io/2019/10/16/lsp-in-vim-with-the-lsc-plugin.html).
- [ ] Get familiar with Vim pure editing [key bindings](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/vi.html) and language specific key bindings.
- [ ] Write script to show the DW-API docs on function name hover in vim-lsp, check [this issue #275](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp#275).
